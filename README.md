# PythonMLToolbox
 A collection of different data science focused python scripts.  The files are mostly algorithms and data cleaning/plotting routines I have written in python.  Both python jupyter notebooks (.ipyn) and standard python files (.py) are included.  The classifiers are designed in an object oriented approach similar to how scikit-learn implements them.
