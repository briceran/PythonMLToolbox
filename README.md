# PythonMLToolbox
 A collection of different data science focused python scripts.  The files are mostly algorithms and data cleaning/plotting routines written in python.  The classifiers are designed in an object oriented approach similar to the implementation in scikit-learn.


 AdalineGD : Implementation of the Adaline(adaptive linear neuron) single layer neural network.
 AdalineSGD : Adaline with stochastic gradient descent.
 BayesBandit : Bayesian solution to the multi-arm bandit problem.  Can be extended to bayesian A/B testing.
 forwardprop : implementation of a feed forward neural network.
 LogisticRegressionGD : Logistic regression implementation.
 Perceptron : Classic perceptron algorithm.
